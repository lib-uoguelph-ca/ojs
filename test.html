<h1>HTML5 Looping Audio with Flash Fallback Test</h1>

<!--
HTML5 <audio> tag for modern browsers.

The controls can be removed if necessary. They are provided by the
browser itself so there is not much that can be done to style them or
change their size.

Note the autoplay and loop attributes.

We would have to test, but it looks like most browsers support at
least WAV and MP3, and maybe OGG Vorbis and M4A.
-->
<audio id="player" preload="auto" autoplay="autoplay"
       loop="loop" controls="controls">

  <!-- Set up the audio sources. We prefer OGG Vorbis to MP3 for its openness
  and MP3 to WAV for its file size. -->
  <!-- <source src="/cantoriaDeViola.ogg" type="application/ogg"/> -->
  <source src="/cantoriaDeViola.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/>
  <source src="/cantoriaDeViola.wav" type="audio/wav"/>

  <!-- Fallback to Flash if there is no <audio> support. The Flowplayer flash
  object will load the same MP3 file we referenced above and play it, giving
  it visual controls. -->
  <p id="noscript">Your browser does not support HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; and you either have JavaScript disabled or do not have Flash installed. Download <a href="cantoriaDeViola.mp3">cantoriaDeViola.mp3</a>, which normally plays as background music on this page.</p>
</audio>

<h2>A little bit of background</h2>

<p>This solution does rely on Javascript.</p>

<p>This solution should play an MP3 directly using &lt;audio&gt;. If this does not work it will fall back to playing a WAV file directly using &lt;audio&gt;. If that does not work it will display a Flash player that will load and play the MP3 file.</p>

<p>If JavaScript is unavailable but HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; is available it should play fine. On Chromium or IE9 it will loop properly. On Firefox 4 and Opera it will only play once.</p>

<p>If JavaScript and HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; are both unavailable there will simply be a link to the audio file in MP3 format.</p>

<script language="javascript">
  $(document).ready(audioPlayer('player', 'cantoriaDeViola.mp3'));
